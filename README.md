# BSPD
Brake System Plausibility Device(BSPD)
A standalone non-programmable circuit, the BSPD, opens the shutdown circuit when hard braking occurs, whilst ≥5 kW power is delivered to the motors. The action of opening the shutdown circuit must occur if the implausibility is persistent for more than 500 ms. To detect hard braking, a brake system pressure sensor is used. The threshold is chosen such that there are no locked wheels and the brake pressure is ≤ 30 bar.
To measure power delivery, a DC circuit current sensor is used. The threshold is choosen to an equivalent of ≤5 kW for maximum TS voltage.
